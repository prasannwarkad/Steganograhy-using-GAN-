# Steganograhy-using-GAN-
Academic Project
About Project:-
 -Developed a steganography solution employing GAN neural networks for secure data hiding into image.
 -Created three customized neural models—Basic Encoder, Residual Encoder, and Dense Encoder—tailored for optimal steganography performance.
 -Engineered an Encoder Lever architecture with "Encode" and "Decode" levers, incorporating the three neural models for flexible data concealment.
 -Achieved an impressive payload capacity of 4.4 bits per pixel, maintaining image quality and integrity.
